- I learnt about what string variables
- They are variables with double quotes
- eg. variabl_1 = "hi"

- Integer variables are without quotes

- Expressions are done using double paranthesis $(()). Prefix is dollar$
- read -p allows user input
- echo command echos what we say we have to use echo
- When using mathematical expressions the dollar sign in the variable sign are not required(optional)
