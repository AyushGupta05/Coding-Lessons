# Ayush Grocery supermarket shop bill
# The aim of the program is to generate a bill for the purchased grocery products
# The user will enter what they want and how much they want and we need to calculate the total cost and show it to them
# use read command to get the grocery name and then check what ever the user has entered 
# if the user entered tomato then the price is 10rs
# if the user entered potato, the price is 15rs
# if the user entered carrot the price is 5rs
# if the user entered apple the price is 20rs
# if the user entered banana the price is 15rs
# ask the user how much they want and them multiply the cost into the quantity

vegetable_1="Potato"
# string variable is any variable with double quotes
vegetable_1_price=15
#because their are no double quotes it is called integer variable

vegetable_2="Carrot"
vegetable_2_price=5

vegetable_3="Apple"
vegetable_3_price=20

vegetable_4="Banana"
vegetable_4_price=15
