# summary
- Their are many types of arrays. They are string, integer,float,dictionary,list


student_1={"name":"ayush","age":13,"doj":2016}
student_2={"name":"aarav","age":15,"doj":2011}
student_3={"name":"arjun","age":9,"doj":2019}
student_list=[student_1,student_2,student_3,{"name":"nimral","age":40,"doj":2021}]

I learnt how multiple data types can be used for example a dictionary can be used inside an array and vice versa

# homework
- Someone is giving me 4 boxes, each of these boxes contains a name and the weight of the box,(ayush,45,5). It also contains the number of boxes inside the boxes.

ayush={"name":ayush","weight":45,"boxes":[{"title":"apples","count":10},{"title":"oranges","count":15},{"title":"banana,"count":20}]}
abhinav={"name":Abhinav", "weight":55,"boxes":6}
maisha={"name":saurabh", "weight":70,"boxes":7}
saurabh={"name":manisha", "weight":90,"boxes":10}
big_box=[ayush,abhinav,manisha,saurabh]
print(big_box)
